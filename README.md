# DTOnator

###Motive for project
Writing  DTO(Data Transfer Object) for a single feed takes me more  or less about  30 minutes depending on  the complexity of given data structure  and the repeated look up  between the IDE and the file/browser that representes the feed.

I often felt writing DTO is  a lifeless task particularly when you are working in a highly agile environment and  the deadlines are making you scared. adding further a small typographical  error crept during the creation of a DTO may hide some horrible bugs that may take hours to debug! and may leave you with a huge frustration.

Luckily for your computer creating the DTO is a simple  task and it really  doesn't need the  power of a your smart brain and highly expensive developer hours! your smart IDE can complete that task for the smarter you,And it takes just a few seconds!!!.

creating such a tool for the software craftsman and helping him in better utilization of his time and energy is the basic motive and a fascinating idea that made me to create this project


#####A special thanks to creator of the repository https://github.com/zzz40500/GsonFormat
This is the repository which gave me the idea of bringing a dto generator to an IDE.
