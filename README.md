# DTOnator

###Motive for project
Being a professional android developer with a little  good skill in touch typing,In my very first project writing  DTO(Data Transfer Object) for a single API took me more  or less about  30 minutes depending on  the complexity of given data structure  and the repeated look up  between the IDE and the file/browser that represented the feed. And I were working on a project which involved huge amount of such API's, which also mean I spent huge time writing DTO's.

I often felt writing DTO is  a lifeless task particularly when you are working in a highly agile environment and  the deadlines are making you scared. adding further a small typographical  error crept during the creation of a DTO may hide some horrible bugs that may take hours to debug! and may leave you with a huge frustration.

Luckily for your computer creating the DTO is a simple  task and it really  doesn't need the  power of a smart human brain and highly expensive developer hours! your smart IDE can complete that task for the smarter you,And it takes a time far less than 3 seconds!!!.

creating such a tool for the software craftsman and helping him in better utilization of his time and energy is the basic motive and a fascinating idea that made me to create this project

###Why one more DTO generator when there are already so many  DTO generators in this world?
Most of the existing tools

*Doesn't brings the DTO generator close to an IDE

*Doesn't include annotations that are particular to android

*Doesn't provides an option to use craftsman's personal style while generating DTO's

*Forces you to use either single file or multiple file conventions for representing DTO's

last but not the least I wanted to apply the  design patterns that I freshly learnt and wanted to create a project by TDD

###A special thanks to creator of the repository https://github.com/nvinayshetty/GsonFormat
This is the repository which gave me the idea of bringing a dto generator to an IDE.
