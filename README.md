# DTOnator

###Motive for project
Even for a developer with some good skill in touch typing writing a DTO for the given feed takes more  or less about 
30 minuts depending on  the complexity/sensitivity of given feed and the repeated look up  between
the IDE and the file/browser that presents the feed to that Developer.

I offten feel writing DTO is  a lifeless task perticularly when you are working in a highly agile environment and 
the deadlines are making you scared. adding further a small typographical  error crept during the creatin of a DTO 
may hide some horrible bugs that may take hours to debug!.

Luckily creating the DTO is repetative task and it really  doesn't need the decision taking power of a intellijient
human brain and highly expensive developer time! your smart tools can complete that task for the smarter you  and
it takes a time far less than 3 secoends!!!. creating such a tool for the software craftsman and helping him in better
utililzation of his time and ennergy is the basic motive and a fascinating idea that made me to create this project

###Why one more DTO generator when there are already so many  DTO generators in this world?
Most of the exisiting tools

*Doesn't brings the tools close to an IDE

*Doesn't include annotaions

*Doesn't provides an option to use his personal style while generating DTO's

*Use there own naming conventions

*Forces you to use either single file or multiple file conventions for representing DTO's
